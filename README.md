# Problem Desciption
This is a classical problem of process synchronization and mutual exclusion where a shared file is being accessed by multiple processes (amongst which some want to read it called as readers and others want to write to it called as writers) concurrently. So, we need to synchronize these processes so as to avoid race condition.
# Starve Free Solution
All readers and writers will be granted access to the resource in their order of arrival (FIFO order). If a writer arrives while readers are accessing the resource, it will wait until those readers free the resource, and then modify it as soon as the resource is released by the reader. New readers arriving in the meantime will have to wait.
***This Problem can be solved using Semaphores and Mutex***
## Constraints
1. Any number of Readers can access database when there are no active writers.
1. Writers can access database when there are no readers and other writers (i.e, only one at a time).
1. At any time, Only a single thread can manipulate state variables.
## Implementation of Queue
A queue is used to maintain the blocked processes in their order of arrival. The first process to enter is waken up first so as to ensure that no process waits for too long.
Besides, this helps to give a fair chance to both readers and writers to execute without any starvation.
``` c
// A struct for a node of the queue.
struct Node{
    Node* next;  //pointer to the next node in the queue
    pid_t pid; // process id of the current process
};

// Implementation of queue
class Queue{
    /* Queue implements the FIFO behavior
    where addition of new nodes takes place at the tail of the queue 
    while deletion of node takes place at the head of the queue*/
    Node* Front; // front pointer to acess the first node of the queue; required during pop operation
    Node* Rear; //rear pointer to acess the last node of the queue; required during pushing a new node at the end of the queue
    
    public:
    // Implementation of push() that adds node at the queue's tail
   	void push(pid_t val){
        Node* n = new Node();  // create a new node -> to be later pushed in the queue
        n->pid = val;       // initialize the pid value of the node with function's argument
        
        if(Front == NULL) Front = n; // if queue is empty, point the front to the newly added node
        else Rear->next = n; //else update the next pointer of rear to point to newly added node
        
        Rear = n; // update the rear pointer
    }
    
    // Implementation of pop() that takes out the node from the queue's front
    pid_t pop(){
        if(Front == NULL) return -1; // if queue is empty, underflow error as no node can be popped out
        else{
            pid_t pop_id = Front->pid; // get the pid of the node to be popped
            
            Front = Front->next;  // update front pointer to point to the next node; indicating front node has been popped
            
            if(Front == NULL) Rear = NULL;  // if after pop, queue is empty , update rear
            
            return pop_id;
        }
    }
};
```
## Semaphore
Semaphores are used as signalling mechanism between multiple co-operating processes to access the critical section. It has 2 atomic operations wait() and signal().
```c
// Implementation of Semaphore (counting semaphore that can take any  int value)
class Semaphore{
    int value = 1;  
    // the shared variable to keep track of processes, the negative value indicates no. of suspended processes
    Queue blocked = Queue(); // queue of blocked process waiting for wake up by some other process
    
    public:
    /* wait() operation is used by a process whenever it wants to either access the critical section or some shared resource,
    it checks the availability of resource and if possible then access it and block other processes from accessing the same by decrementing the value
    else it itself gets blocked and move to blocked queue where it waits for some wake up call by some other process
    */
    void wait(pid_t pid){
        value = value-1;
        if(value < 0){
            blocked.push(pid); // add this process to the blocked queue
            wait(pid); // put this process in wait state until waked up by some other process
        }
    }
    /*signal() operation is used by a process to wake up some sleeping process from the blocked queue,
    it implies that now the resource has been used up by the previous process and is available to be accessed by some of the sleeping processes
    */
    void signal(){
        value++;
        if(value <= 0){
            pid_t pid = blocked.pop(); // pop the front process from the blocked queue
            wakeup(pid);  // wakeup the popped process as it can again enter the ready state and can try for its execution
        }
    }
};
```
## Global Variables
### Readers_count : 
initialized as 0 // indicates number of readers currently accessing the critical section
### Data: 
initialized as 1 // can be initialized by any value , this is the value modified by writer during write process
### Order_mutex: 
Semaphore used for maintaining fifo order of read/write requests made for accessing critical section
### Access_mutex: 
Semaphore used for requesting exclusive access to modify reader_count variable
### Readers_mutex: 
Semaphore used for avoiding conflicting accesses to entry and exit section (aiding in achieving mutual exclusion condition that only one reader can enter/ exit the critical section at a time) as multiple readers can simultaneously access the resource/ critical section. 
``` c
// Declaring the 3 Semaphores to be used in this problem
Semaphore order_mutex, access_mutex, readers_mutex;
int data = 0,readers_count = 0;
```
## Reader's Code
First the reader checks for its turn using order_mutex, if some writer is in the critical section then a reader won't be allowed until it is done. Once the reader enters the entry section, it uses readers_mutex to ensure mutual exclusion i.e, only one reader can be in the entry section and can modify readers_count at a time. If it is the first reader then it waits for the access permission for the shared resource and after getting the access locks it for the writers. If multiple readers come then they need not to re-lock the resource again. Then the reader enters the critical section to perform the read operation from the shared resource. Multiple readers can be in the critical section to read the resource at the same time. When a reder is in exit section, again mutual exclusion is ensured as only single process can modify readers_count. If it is the last reader then, access to the resource is released so that any waiting writer can access it. Else, the resource won't be unlocked till reader's complete their operation. Finally, the readers_mutex is released as now any process can modify it.
``` c
void *reader(pid_t pid){
    /*          < ENTRY section>               */
  order_mutex.wait(pid); //check for its turn to get executed, if can't access the resorces currently then wait till other processes are serviced
  readers_mutex.wait(pid); // requesting access to modify readers count, only one can modify it at a time, mutual exclusion achieved
  
  readers_count++; // increment number of readers
  
  if(readers_count==1) access_mutex.wait(pid);
  // if it is the first reader then wait till other writers release the resource semaphore
  
  order_mutex.signal(pid); // release the semaphore to get the next reader/ writer to be serviced
  readers_mutex.signal(pid); // release access to modify readers count
  
  
 /*         <CRITICAL SECTION>          */
  printf("Data read by the reader%d is %d\n",*((int *) pid),data);
  
  /*        <EXIT SECTION>              */
  
  readers_mutex.wait(pid); // again request access to readers count, onlu one can modify it at a time
  readers_count--; //  decrement the count as a reader is leaving
  
  if(readers_count==0) access_mutex.signal(pid);
  // if it is the last reader then release the access to the critical section after reading is done so that it can be used by any waiting writer
   
  readers_mutex.signal(pid); // release access to modify readers count
}
```
## Writer's Code
Once the writer enters in the entry section it waits till other requests are serviced. Then it gets access to the resource and locks it until writing is done. It releases the order_mutex to allow other requests to be serviced meanwhile. After the writing operation is completed, it enters in exit section where it unlocks the resource for other processes.
``` c
void *writer(pid_t pid){
  /*        <ENTRY SECTION>     */
  order_mutex.wait(pid); //Wait in queue till other requests are serviced
  access_mutex.wait(pid); // get the access to the writer for accessing the critical section and block the readers from accessing it
  order_mutex.signal(pid); // release the semaphore to get the next reader/ writer to be serviced
  
  /*        CRITICAL SECTION        */
  data = data* 2 + 5; //modify the value of data during writing
  
  /*        EXIT section            */
  access_mutex.signal(pid); //release the access to the critical section so that it can be used by any waiting reader
}
```
## Correctness of Solution
### Mutual Exclusion:
The access_mutex semaphore ensure that only a single writer can access the critical section at any moment, aiding in mutual exclusion amongst writers. As, if any other writer try to enter then the value of access_mutex wonâ€™t allow it to do so.
Besides, when the first reader enter in critical section it calls wait(access_mutex) that aids in mutual exclusion between readers and writers as at that moment it blocks the writer.

### Bounded Wait:
Before accessing the critical section both reader and writer use order_mutex which checks for the turn of the request made. If currently the request canâ€™t be granted then it blocks that thread and puts it in the FIFO queue. This ensures that when a thread needs to be released,it is done in FIFO sequence so that all get an opportunity of being executed after a finite amount of time and no one starves for an indefinite long  time. This meets the requirement for bounded wait conditions.

### Progress Requirement:
The code is structured so that there wonâ€™t be any chances of occurrence of deadlock. Both the reader and writer take a finite amount of time in critical section execution and during exit release the waiting semaphore so that they can release the blocked threads/ processes for re- cheking and entering in critical section. Thus, no process hinders the execution of the other when there is no reader/ writer in the critical section.
